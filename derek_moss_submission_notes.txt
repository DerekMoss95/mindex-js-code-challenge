Derek Moss's Notes:
The main reference that I used to help me build out this project:
https://www.freakyjolly.com/angular-material-table-operations-using-dialog/

-I added the compensation field to the employee.ts file
-I put this as a function in employee.component.ts and it tells you how many direct reports this person has right after the ID value in each tile
-I listed the direct reports of each employee (if any) and put them into a material table. This was accomplished in employee.component.ts and employee.component.html
-I added the buttons to edit and delete rows for each direct report under each employee that had direct reports however, I made all values editable, not just compensation because it looked better. I would like to find a way to keep the styling the same for those rows in the dialog box but still disable input
-I registered a new dialog component that works pretty well overall which gives the user a edit dialog box to enter or edit information, or to delete a row from the table under that employee's direct reports. 
-I didn't create an event emitter as the project started taking too much time when I have other outside obligations going on. This is a topic I am not familiar with either but it seems interesting from the few minutes of research I did on event emitters. 
-I styled the page lightly but moving it into 2 rows of 2 but beyond that I didn't add much styling as I wanted to focus on the functionaly more 

Thanks for the consideration! This was a fun project to work on in my free time as time permitted.
